## To Do:
* Go back to Act_As_Votable and cache appropriate columns in order to have it run faster
* Only allow bill updates on those users who have admin rights
* Put limits on the length of the bill attributes
* Titles inside the bill containers
* Rename description field in DB to legislation
* Alter default sizing on bill images
